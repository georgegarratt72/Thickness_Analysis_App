        This application is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of thickness uniformity for materials, typically in a manufacturing or quality control context. It separates the analysis into two key stages:
        - **Pre-OL:** Analysis of the material thickness at the print stage.
        - **Post-OL:** Analysis after the OL dip, allowing for comparison and assessment of the process's impact on uniformity.
        
        The application calculates two key metrics:
        - **TUS (Targeted Uniformity Score):** Measures how close the thickness profile is to a desired target mean thickness and how uniform it is.
        - **RUS (Relative Uniformity Score):** Measures the intrinsic uniformity of the profile, regardless of its proximity to the target.
